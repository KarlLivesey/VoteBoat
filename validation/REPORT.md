# Validation report — slice 35

The independent Rust model in `tests/ballot_model.rs` explores the complete
reachable closure within explicit finite bounds: seven configuration phases,
four candidate/store identities (including one reused NodeId), two local replica
identities, terms 0–2, and at most one restart. No search-depth cutoff is used;
a three-million-state resource cap fails the test if reached.

Actions separate accepted state, write completion, synchronization, exact
completion, durable crash recovery and recovery of a complete unsynchronized
tail. They include learner staging, two joint/final transitions, store replacement,
uncommitted rollback, committed-prefix compaction and higher-term observation.
Commit advancement is an external quorum oracle. Stale completion is ignored;
restart does not produce a vote reply.

The correct model explores **237,556 states and 665,097 edges** with no invariant
violation. It reaches all seven phases, historical origins ahead of a rolled-back
head and behind a compacted base, and a replacement-store ballot. Invariants check
prefix/term bounds, original candidate eligibility, retained per-term durable
promises, receipt durability/incarnation, and quiescent core/disk agreement.

Three negative controls produce counterexamples:

| Deliberate defect | States to counterexample | Observed violation |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Erase vote when rollback removes candidate | 5,835 | Durable promise erased in its term after joint rollback |
| Reply at Write | 44 | Reply precedes recoverable promise |
| Compare candidate NodeId without store identity | 75,905 | Replacement store changes a durable same-term promise |

Run `cargo +stable test --locked --offline --no-default-features --test ballot_model -- --nocapture`
for exploration counts and exact counterexample traces. The implementation's host,
native, actual-file and actual-core tests are separate evidence; the model does
not import production helpers or establish their refinement automatically.

This finite local model is not a full distributed membership proof. Network
partitions, log matching/leader completeness, distributed quorum commitment,
unbounded terms/restarts, liveness and resource fairness remain outside it.
Online reconfiguration stays gated pending its distributed model and faulted
actual network histories. Linux local execution does not establish macOS or
hardware power-failure behavior. CI is background feedback, never a required
merge gate or a reason to stop local implementation.

## Slice 36 — actual-core replication scope evidence

Seven additional internal tests drive the real receive, persist, completion and
snapshot-install paths behind the public configuration-data gate. They exercise
retained-voter catch-up, matching-prefix bounds, joint/final rollback, request
scope independent of snapshot base, compacted hints, exact application dependencies,
and stale-context/learner/read/election rejection. Four public downstream tests
exercise host/native static-log scope bridges, failed barriers/recovery and native
wire format 2. See [scope rules and limitations](../docs/REPLICATION_SCOPES.md).

The independent local ballot model above is unchanged. These finite core tests
are not a distributed activation model, a refinement proof or online network
membership evidence. Newly promoted sender authorization and the other listed
release gates remain incomplete. CI remains background feedback.

## Slice 37 — learner enrollment/recovery evidence

Eight downstream learner tests use public contracts with explicit host-authorized
assignment import. Host/native histories check exact committed and accepted local
store assignment, service/vote/read exclusion, completion ordering, snapshot/data
verification, application replay and refusal of joint/policy recovery. Native
histories cut every assignment-frame byte and inject failed barriers. An actual
log/snapshot-file history closes and reopens a compacted, physically reclaimed
learner and verifies its exact state. One timed-runtime test checks durable
replication with no learner election timer. See [learner recovery](../docs/LEARNER_RECOVERY.md).

The assignment import is a trusted host action, not proof of an online remote
commit. Promoted-sender authorization, learner readiness, dynamic recovery and
the distributed model/network membership gates remain unfinished. The local
ballot model above is unchanged; no full proof or macOS/hardware claim is made.

## Slice 41 reservation evidence

The final default-feature library/runtime/effect-owner run passes 26/25/94 tests;
the executable service/routing and downstream startup suites pass 6/5 tests.
These are Linux checks, including actual loopback TLS/worker histories. Four new
core fixtures cover prospective append/snapshot and intermediate joint fanout,
rollback through learner/final shrink, committed shrink, compacted membership,
checked overflow, pure inspection and continued rejection of online configuration
ingress. Two downstream tests cover exact non-consuming queue selection and
oversized-input rejection without queue/ticket/core/timer mutation, plus continued
control service and admission under held output reservations. The core-only run
passes 18/18/90 tests; its run preceded the final held-lease assertion checked in
the default suite. This slice does not change the finite ballot model or establish
distributed membership activation, macOS compatibility or performance evidence.

## Slice 42 dynamic recovery evidence

Eleven new downstream member recovery tests exercise host/native joint versus
final elections, weighted final policy, exact committed/accepted assignments,
replacement stores, learner exclusion, historical ballots, final rollback,
verified snapshots and missing data. Native model histories cut every byte of a
joint frame and inject synchronization/manifest failures; the recovered role
matches a complete old or new membership. A real native-file history compacts,
reclaims, closes/reopens both providers and checks dynamic membership, application
state and duplicate operation behavior. Imported committed assignments and
simulated election replies are explicit fixture premises, not network certificates.

The default-feature library/ballot/learner/member/membership/Raft/snapshot suites
pass 26/10/8/11/27/22/19 tests; core-only versions pass 18/3/4/7/16/10/8.
The final service/startup run passes 6/5 tests after fixture listeners are retained
for fake peers and all placeholder child listeners are released before launching
the first child. Earlier fixture bind failures are not counted as passing runs.
No persistent/wire format or finite ballot model changed. These Linux checks do
not establish promoted-leader network authorization, online membership,
distributed activation proof, macOS execution or performance.
